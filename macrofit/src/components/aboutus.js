					<h1>About Us</h1>

						
					<p>Founded in May 2018 in the friendly confines of the Rutgers Atrium in Central Jersey 
					Macrofit is a website dedicated in educating individuals who are in the pursuit of higher fitness goals.</p>
					
					<p>The inspiration behind this app was education of its users on how food and nutrition works. There are so many
					false advertisents on social media that actually steer people in the wrong direction when it comes to achieving goals.</p>

					<p>The two founding members of Macrofit are Zach Schneider and Eric Hasrie. Both students of the Rutgers Coding Bootcamp
					under the expert tutelege of Franklin Dawes.</p>
